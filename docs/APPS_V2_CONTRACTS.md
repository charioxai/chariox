# Apps v2 contracts (frozen by R0)

The shared seams of Apps v2 Stage 1 (`spikes/wasm/APPS_V2_PLAN.md` §4). The Rust
types are the source of truth; this page says what each one fixes and which
existing kernel mechanism it reuses. Canonical vectors live next to the tests:
`packages/app-package/tests/vectors/v2/` and `packages/app-runtime/tests/vectors/`.
A vector failing means an encoding or rule changed. Regenerate only for a
deliberate contract change (`CHARIOX_UPDATE_VECTORS=1`) and review the diff.

## 1. Package v2 (`chariox_app_package::v2`)

- Schema `chariox.app.v2`, contract version 2, RFC 8785 JSON, canonical USTAR,
  Ed25519. Signing subject: canonical `{schema:"chariox.package-signature.v2",
  manifest, inventory}`; inventory schema `chariox.integrity.v2`. A v1 and a v2
  signature can never verify as the other.
- `ManifestV2` adds `world` (exact, `chariox:app/app@1.0.0`), `runtime
  {engine:"wasm", component}`, `build {language, toolchain, sdkVersion}`,
  `uiActions` and `requiredFeatures`; it drops `sdkVersion`/`minKernelProtocol`.
  `requiredFeatures` must equal the features the content uses (`wasm-component`,
  `ui-actions`, `agent-panel`, `connections`, `directed-events`), so a package
  cannot understate them. The kernel states which features it supports; no
  protocol number is copied into a package.
- `schemas/ui-actions.json` (`UiActionDeclaration`): name, description, input
  and optional output schema, `effect` `read | write | approval`, and an
  `approvalReason` for, and only for, `approval`. Backend `actions` keep their
  protected effect routes unchanged; an effect class grants no capability.
- Signature slots: `signatures/publisher.sig` plus up to 8
  `signatures/reviews/<reviewer-key-id>.json` (`chariox.package-review.v1`, at
  most 16 KiB, canonical JSON, opaque `attestation`). Reviews are excluded from the
  inventory and returned *unverified*; they grant nothing. Any other
  `signatures/` entry or review schema is refused (`IncompatibleContract`).
  Packages without reviews are valid on every route.
- Three digests (`PackageDigests`): `content` (the signing subject, which holds
  every payload digest), `publisher_archive` (canonical archive with review
  entries removed) and `delivered` (the exact bytes). Review changes alter only
  `delivered`; changed UI alters `content` and `publisher_archive`.
- Error mapping reuses existing `ErrorCode`s: unknown world or signature
  format → `IncompatibleContract`; missing kernel feature →
  `IncompatibleProtocol`; `.cwasm`, `.so` and similar → `UnsupportedFeature`.
- Reuses: `archive.rs`, `json.rs`, inventory/signature readers and
  `verify_signature` (now shared with v1), `Declarations` (now validated against
  `Capabilities`, not a v1 manifest), `TrustedPublisher` from the enrolled store.

## 2. App ID, publisher and principals (`v2::identity`)

- `AppId` keeps the v1 reverse-DNS syntax. `AppId::namespaces()` lists the
  namespaces whose verified owner may hold it: `io.github.<login>.<app>` → that
  GitHub account only; otherwise each domain whose reversed labels start the ID
  (`com.example.tools.todo` → `tools.example.com`, `example.com`). Local IDs are
  never checked against them.
- `SignerPrincipal::{Dev, Publisher}`; the reserved publisher id
  `local_dev` (`DEV_PUBLISHER_ID`, not a possible DNS label or GitHub login) is the
  kernel dev identity.
- `registration_outcome(bound, signer)` → `Bind`, `Preserve`, or a refusal
  (`DevIdentity`, `PublisherConflict`). It never overwrites a binding.
- Reuses: `Publisher`, `publisher_trust` enrollment (the dev identity is never
  enrolled there).
- Not frozen here (I1): DNS/website challenge names, transfers, confusables.

## 3. Channels (`installation::channel`)

- `InstallationChannel {dev, release}` is the installation; `UpdateChannel
  {stable, preview}` is an optional subscription of a release installation;
  `AcquisitionSource` is provenance only.
- `resolve(installations, selector)`: owner + App ID + channel + dev Room.
  Automatic selection uses the dev copy only in its own Room, else release.
  Several matches are `Ambiguous`, never first-match. A dev installation has
  exactly one Room and no subscription (`InstallationRef::validate`).
- `check_immutable_version`: `(publisher, App ID, version)` names immutable
  content; different bytes at it fail. Dev saves are identified by digest.
- Reuses: the existing installation id as runtime/data anchor.

## 4. Activation and approval (`installation::activation`)

- `activation_entry`: no installation → `BeginAppInstall`; otherwise
  `BeginAppUpdate` with the expected generation. Every source uses it.
- `check_source`: `dev_push` ⇔ dev channel ⇔ dev principal; every other source
  ⇔ release channel ⇔ publisher principal.
- `AuthoritySet`: sorted atoms for network (origin+method), clipboard, files,
  workflows, agents, connections, effect routes, and `critical-route` /
  `verified-route` for critical routes. Action names, texts and schemas are not
  authority. `approval_requirement(approved, candidate)` → `Reuse` unless the
  candidate adds atoms (`Prompt{added}`); first installs always prompt.
  `commit_gate` repeats the check on the kernel writer against the current
  approved set and publisher-trust revision.
- Reuses: `CapabilityApproval`/`CapabilityDecision`, the stage/prepare/commit
  journal, `RuntimeInteraction` for the single prompt, `publisher_trust` revisions.

## 5. WIT versioning (`v2::world`)

- `WorldId` = `<ns>:<pkg>/<world>@<semver>` (no pre-release). `check_world`
  against `SupportedWorld {name, major, minor}`: older minor links, newer minor
  or unknown major is refused, patch is ignored; two entries for one name give
  the two-major deprecation window. `APP_WORLD` and `MIGRATION_WORLD` are the
  fixed names; the import allowlist and window text are R1.
- Compatibility for the Library is this same check plus `kernel_features`.

## 6. AOT cache (`release_store::aot_key`)

- `AotCacheKey` = component digest, wasmtime version, worker build, engine
  config digest, target triple, CPU-feature policy; `id()` is the digest of its
  canonical JSON. `AotProvenance` records the key, source release and artifact
  digest; `usable_by(running)` is key equality, so any worker/wasmtime update
  invalidates entries. `.cwasm` is never accepted in a package.
- Reuses: the verified release store for the retained component bytes.

## 7. Data and migrations (`managed_state::data_contract`)

- Data belongs to the installation (dev and release separate). `accept_migration
  (data_version, release_target)` → `AlreadyCurrent`, `Forward{steps}` or
  `Downgrade` (refused). `recovery(stage, compatible_migration)`: before commit
  `RestorePriorRelease`; after commit `CompatibleMigration` or
  `BlockedPreservingData`, never a discard of accepted writes.
- Migration steps are `.wasm` components in `chariox:app/migration@1.0.0`.
- Reuses: `managed_state` snapshots/journal and the private-volume snapshot;
  event identities and receipts stay outside rollbackable data.

## 8. View actions and the signed declarations (A1)

- The view registers what the signed `schemas/ui-actions.json` declares, through
  `chariox.action(declaration, handler)` or `<form data-chariox-action>`
  (`browser-app-view-actions.mjs`, injected by the App bridge). A registration
  has the `UiActionDeclaration` shape; there is no second format. The page
  grants nothing: the kernel compares and decides.
- `check_registration(declared, registered)` (A2: at registration and before each
  invocation) refuses an undeclared action or one whose effect, approval reason,
  input/output schema or description differs. `check_agreement(declared,
  registered)` (A4: `/app actions`) also refuses duplicates and declared actions
  the view never registered. Both return a typed `UiActionMismatch` naming the
  action and the differing part. Schemas compare in RFC 8785 form, so key order
  and number spelling are not differences. Vectors: `ui-action-agreement.json`.
- A2 reads the page only through `__charioxViewAgent` (non-writable global):
  `registrations()`, `invoke(name, params)`, `state()`, `changes(since, waitMs)`.
  Answers are `{ok, value}` or `{ok:false, code, message}`; bounds are 64 KiB
  state, 256 KiB result, 16 KiB per change, 256 buffered changes.
- Form markup derives its schema from simple controls (text-like, number,
  checkbox, radio, select, textarea, password, and fields the product masks);
  hidden, file and multi-select controls are not agent input. An agent may
  enter a value it knows into a password or masked field; the product keeps
  masking what a Vault fill put there in model-bound observations. Anything
  richer uses `chariox.action`, whose schema the developer writes.

## 9. The agent bridge and the runtime MCP catalog (A2)

- **Tools.** An agent holding an App grant gets `chariox.app_view_catalog`,
  `_invoke`, `_state`, `_changes` and `_batch` on the existing runtime MCP. They
  address the open views of the agent's own Room by the id the catalog lists.
  A view's actions come only from the signed declarations of the generation it
  runs (`AppCatalog::ui_actions()`; empty for v1 packages, filled by R4).
- **Order of gates for `invoke`.** Grant (`AppViewAuthority`, rechecked at every
  step, cancelling the wait when revoked) → generation (a view of an older one
  is `APP_VIEW_STALE`) → declared (`find_declared`) → input against the signed
  schema (`check_input`) → approval for an `approval` action → the view's one
  queue → the page's registration against the declaration
  (`check_registered`) → the call. Nothing reaches the page before the last step.
- **Approval.** An `approval` action asks through the kernel interaction
  `app-view-action-*` (allow once / deny, shown on every client of the Room;
  `/sudo` answers it like a provider permission). `batch` never decides one: it
  stops before the first approval step and reports it.
- **Batch.** Every step is checked first (`plan_batch`), then run in order. It
  stops at the first error or approval and reports `completed` and `stopped`;
  there is no rollback.
- **One queue per view.** `AppViews::agent_queue` serializes agent calls on a
  view. The controller (`browser.app.agent`) adds a deadline and refuses
  `view_busy` while a handler that missed its deadline still runs.
- **Actor attribution (answers A1 question 2).** The call is the agent's input
  to the Tab: the controller records the agent (`noteAgent`) before the page can
  run, so a `chariox.call` made by the handler, or by anything the handler
  starts, runs as that agent with that agent's App grant, like the agent's
  clicks. With two agents on one view, a stray call of either is refused
  (`APP_ACTOR_UNKNOWN`) until the view is reopened, as for input.
- **Redaction (answers A1 question 3).** State, results, changes and App error
  messages go through the Room's secret observation scrub
  (`room_secret_observations.scrub`) before reaching the model; the protection
  being unavailable withholds the answer. Values the agent supplies are its own.
- **Errors** are `{code, message}` with a stable code: `unknown_view`,
  `unknown_action`, `invalid_input`, `view_mismatch`, `action_not_registered`,
  `approval_denied`, `APP_VIEW_STALE`, `AGENT_APP_NOT_GRANTED`,
  `view_busy`, `deadline`, `view_reloaded`, `view_unavailable`, `withheld`, or
  the App's own code.
- **Waits for R4/L1.** Declarations of an installed App exist only once a v2
  package installs; until then catalogs list views with no actions.
