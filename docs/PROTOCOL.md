# Arroba v1 Protocol

## Status

Draft protocol aligned with `docs/spec-v1.md`.

## 1. Scope

This document defines message classes and protocol contracts between:

- clients
- server relay
- daemon
- provider adapters

It is intentionally transport-agnostic at the message level (WebSocket recommended for remote relay).

## 2. Design Principles

- preserve native PTY behavior for provider interaction
- keep structured control surface intentionally small
- isolate capability/control errors from terminal stream
- ensure user-generated in-transit payloads are session-E2E encrypted on remote transport

## 3. Protocol Lanes

## 3.1 Terminal Lane (Unstructured PTY Stream)

Purpose:

- user keystrokes to provider PTY
- provider stdout/stderr/control sequences to clients

Semantics:

- byte-stream-like behavior
- no requirement for structured parse by Arroba

Suggested events:

- `terminal.input`
- `terminal.output`
- `terminal.resize`

## 3.2 Capability Lane (Structured Daemon Actions)

Purpose:

- daemon-owned operations invoked from overlay/command palette

Suggested request envelope:

- `request_id`
- `session_id`
- `capability`
- `args`
- `sent_at`

Suggested result envelope:

- `request_id`
- `status` (`ok` | `error`)
- `result` or `error`
- `completed_at`

Capabilities in v1:

- `shell.run`
- `dir.tree`
- `file.view`
- `file.edit`
- `screenshot.capture`
- `git.info`
- `file.transfer`
- `file.attach_transferred`
- `context.compact` (mapped from `<reserved character for arroba commands>compact`)
- `schedule.*`

## 3.3 Control Lane (Structured Daemon->Provider Adapter)

Canonical operations in v1:

- `attach_file`
- `request_memory_update`
- `request_compaction_summary`

These operations are not typed by users into terminal traffic.

## 4. Common Message Envelope

All structured messages (capability/control) should carry:

- `version` (protocol version, e.g. `v1`)
- `lane` (`capability` | `control`)
- `type` (event/action identifier)
- `request_id` (for request/response matching)
- `session_id`
- `provider_run_id` (when relevant)
- `payload`
- `meta` (timestamps, source attachment id, trace id)

## 5. Control Operations

## 5.1 `attach_file`

Request payload:

- `session_id`
- `provider_run_id`
- `absolute_path`
- optional `display_name`
- optional `mime_type`

Response payload:

- on success: `attachment_ref` (provider-specific), optional metadata
- on unsupported: `unsupported: true`
- on error: structured error object

## 5.2 `request_memory_update`

Purpose:

- daemon-driven memory-refresh inquiry (out-of-band from terminal prompts)

Request payload:

- `session_id`
- `provider_run_id`
- `reason_code` (`compaction_detected` | `user_requested_refresh` | `before_provider_switch` | custom)
- optional `policy_hint` (`recency_only` | `full_update` | custom)

Response payload:

- on success: structured memory update payload (recency summary, continuity markers, provider-supported hints)
- on unsupported: `unsupported: true`
- on error: structured error object

Failure contract:

- errors must not terminate provider run by default
- daemon falls back to Arroba-managed memory data

## 5.3 `request_compaction_summary`

Purpose:

- daemon-driven compaction-summary inquiry for user-triggered Arroba compaction

Request payload:

- `session_id`
- `provider_run_id`
- `reason_code` (`user_triggered_compact` | custom)
- optional `policy_hint` (`brief` | `detailed` | custom)

Response payload:

- on success: structured compaction summary payload
- on unsupported: `unsupported: true`
- on error: structured error object

Failure contract:

- errors must not terminate provider run by default
- daemon may fallback to Arroba-managed memory summary for warm-start

## 6. Error Model

Structured error shape:

- `code`
- `message`
- optional `retryable`
- optional `details`

Error isolation rules:

- capability/control errors are reported separately from PTY terminal output
- unsupported control operations are valid compatibility outcomes

## 7. Session and Attachment Semantics

- multiple attachments can observe a session
- controller lease indicates active controlling attachment
- lease changes are broadcast as structured session events

Suggested events:

- `session.attachment.joined`
- `session.attachment.left`
- `session.controller.changed`
- `session.provider_run.changed`

## 8. Security Semantics

## 8.1 Encryption

For remote transport, user-generated payloads (terminal/capability/memory transfer artifacts) should be session-E2E encrypted.

## 8.2 Relay behavior

Server should relay opaque encrypted payloads and avoid plaintext dependency.

## 8.3 Metadata minimization

Only operational metadata required for discovery/presence/scheduling should be stored server-side in v1.

## 9. Compatibility Rules

- provider adapters may support PTY-only operation
- control-lane unsupported responses are expected and non-fatal
- protocol evolution should be additive within `v1` where possible

## 10. Versioning Strategy

- every structured message carries `version`
- breaking changes require a new major protocol version
- new optional fields/capabilities may be introduced as backward-compatible extensions

## 11. Cross-Platform Terminal Conformance Profile

To keep behavior consistent across CLI, web, desktop, and mobile clients:

- terminal behavior is specified by protocol semantics, not by one UI framework
- clients may be implemented in platform-native languages and toolkits
- clients should conform to shared expectations for:
  - PTY byte-stream fidelity
  - terminal resize behavior (`terminal.resize`)
  - key/input mapping (`terminal.input`)
  - output rendering/control-sequence handling (`terminal.output`)

Reference model:

- xterm.js serves as the reference behavior baseline for web/remote surfaces
- recommended platform hosts for xterm.js-based clients:
  - Web: browser runtime
  - iOS: `WKWebView`
  - Android: `android.webkit.WebView`
  - macOS: `WKWebView` in AppKit/SwiftUI container
  - Windows: WebView2
  - Linux desktop: embedded Chromium/WebKit container
- non-web clients should be validated against the same conformance suite and snapshot expectations
